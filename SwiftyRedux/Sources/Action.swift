/// Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store.
/// They are the only source of information for the store.
/// You send them to the store using store.dispatch().

/// All actions that should be dispatched to a store need to conform to this protocol (currentrly without any requirements)
/// Actions should not contain functions. It can be a struct or enum used to express intended state change.
/// You might conform them to `Equatable` or `Codable` protocols for your needs.
