import Dispatch

/// Solving reader-writer problem here.
/// Wrapper over GCD concurrent queue, that performs concurrent reads and serial writes using barrier flag.
/// It can check whether work is already being executed on the same queue to not put it into then end of the queue, but to execute it here and now.
/// This option is disabled by default for performance reasons, but you can always choose to do so by passing `checkIfAlreadyInQueue` as true.
///
/// btw some good advices on concurrent programming in iOS can be found here: https://www.objc.io/issues/2-concurrency
