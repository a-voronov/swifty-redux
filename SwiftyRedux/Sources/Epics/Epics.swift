/// Inspired by https://redux-observable.js.org
/// Lightweight version which allows listening to and dispatching action on own serial queue scheduler.
/// It is a function which takes a stream of actions and returns a stream of actions. Basically - async pipe.
/// Epics run alongside the normal Redux dispatch channel, *after* the reducers have already received them â€“
/// so you cannot "swallow" an incoming action.
/// Actions always run through your reducers _before_ your Epics even receive them.
