/// [Epic](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html) is a function which takes a stream of actions
/// and returns a stream of actions. Basically - async pipe. **Actions in, actions out.**
///
/// While you'll most commonly produce actions out in response to some action you received in, that's not actually a requirement.
/// Once you're inside your Epic, use any Observable patterns you desire as long as anything output from the final,
/// returned stream, is an action.
///
/// Epics run alongside the normal Redux dispatch channel, *after* the reducers have already received them â€“
/// so you cannot "swallow" an incoming action. Actions always run through your reducers **before** your Epics even receive them.
///
/// Inspired by [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org) and built on top of
/// [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift).
///
/// - Parameters:
///     - actions: Signal of incoming actions that never fails.
///     - state: State read-only reactive property. Basically - stream of state updates + its current value.
/// - Returns: Signal of outcoming actions that never fails.
///
/// - Attention: In order to not fall into stack overflow when synchronously producing output actions,
///     we're using scheduler that does it asynchronously.
///     Thus it can break order sometimes in which actions should have been dispatched naturally.
///
///     For example, imagine we're sending these actions one after another in a row:
///     ```
///     dispatch(One())
///     dispatch(Two())
///     dispatch(Five())
///     ```
///     If we had an epic that sends actions `Three()` and `Four()` when it receives action `Two()`,
///     there would be no guarantee that they would be dispatched in a correct order:
///     ```
///     One(), Two(), Three(), Four(), Five()
///     ```
